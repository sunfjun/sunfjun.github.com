Links are a basic part of the Internet. They’re what keep it connected, really, so why not make these connections fun? A link hover is what happens when you hover your mouse over a link (obviously). Usually you’ll see an underline, or an underline removed, or a different colour. But there are many ways to show people that they can click, so I thought I’d show you four of my favourites.


h3. 1. Transition

CSS3 has introduced an awesome new property called “transition”. Don’t be scared when I say CSS3, as this degrades perfectly fine and non-supporting browsers will just show a regular hover (I’m looking at you Internet Explorer). You can use this transition property to make your link change colour slowly. It’s a very subtle but nice-looking effect.

You apply the transition like so: 

pre. a:hover {
   color:#000;
   -webkit-transition:color 500ms ease-in;
   -moz-transition:color 500ms ease-in;
   -o-transition:color 500ms ease-in;
   transition:color 500ms ease-in;
}

h3. 2. Shadow

Another CSS3 trick. Make sure to specify this along with a colour, as otherwise it won’t degrade nicely at all and your older browser users will get confused.

pre. a:hover {text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.4);}

h3. 3. Move

This is a simple one, but one that I like and use a lot. You can add some cool interactivity if you slightly alter a link’s position on hover.

pre. a:hover {position: relative; top: 2px;}

p(css_a_3). "I just can’t stay still when you hover me!":/2010/07/25/4-Ideas-For-Styling-Link-Hovers-With-CSS.html

h3. 4. Opacity

pre. a.img {opacity: .5;}

You can see an example of this on the social media links at the bottom of this page. These links also move. 

Well there they are. There’s nothing super mind-blowing here, but it’s the little details that count and will make your website a little more special. Are there any techniques that you like to use? Share them in the comments.
