Just paste the following into your function.php file, save it, and you're done.

<script src="http://gist.github.com/468135.js?file=favicon"></script>

Don't forget to change the favicon url if needed. Also, please note that if the wp_head() function haven't been implemented in your theme, this recipe will not work.
